# StockModeler -A personal project to use machine learning classifiers to predict stock market trends

## Data Source
All data used is downloaded directly from MarketWatch.

## Implementation
Bayes.py is a naive Bayes classifier to predict in 1,5,30 day windows if the value will increase or decrease based on prior trends.

### First Run
Bayes.py trained on 1 year of daily readings from the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA)

### Second Run
Bayes.py trained on 3 years of daily readings from ten symbols

## Next Steps
Results from the prior models show that this is not expressive enough - next run: boosted decision stumps?
